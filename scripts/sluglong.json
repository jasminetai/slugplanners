This course examines a range of conceptual approaches and monographic studies grounded in the history of the U.S. The readings provide various criteria for studying and understanding these phenomena. The course problematizes \"race\" by asking what the readings tell us about \"race-making\" and the reproduction of racial ideologies in specific historical contexts. Similarly, \"ethnicity\" is treated as a historically specific social construct.
